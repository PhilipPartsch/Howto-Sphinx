1. Introduction
===============

1.1. Scope
----------

Process assessment is a disciplined evaluation of an organizational unit’s processes against a process assessment model.

The Automotive SPICE process assessment model (PAM) is intended for use when performing conformant assessments of the
process capability on the development of embedded automotive systems. It was developed in accordance with the
requirements of ISO/IEC 33004.

Automotive SPICE has its own process reference model (PRM), which was developed based on the Automotive SPICE process
reference model 4.5. It was further developed and tailored considering the specific needs of the automotive industry. If
processes beyond the scope of Automotive SPICE are needed, appropriate processes from other process reference models
such as ISO/IEC 12207 or ISO/IEC 15288 may be added based on the business needs of the organization.

The PRM is incorporated in this document and is used in conjunction with the Automotive SPICE process assessment model
when performing an assessment.

This Automotive SPICE process assessment model contains a set of indicators to be considered when interpreting the
intent of the Automotive SPICE process reference model. These indicators may also be used when implementing a process
improvement program subsequent to an assessment.

1.2. Terminology
----------------

Automotive SPICE follows the following precedence for use of terminology:

a) ISO/IEC 33001 for assessment related terminology

b) ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 terminology (as contained in Annex C)

c) Terms introduced by Automotive SPICE (as contained in Annex C)

The Automotive SPICE process assessment model and process reference model is conformant with the ISO/IEC 33004, and can
be used as the basis for conducting an assessment of process capability.

ISO/IEC 33020 is used as an ISO/IEC 33003 compliant Measurement Framework.

A statement of compliance of the process assessment model and process reference model with the requirements of ISO/IEC
33004 is provided in Annex A.

3. Process capability determination
===================================

The concept of process capability determination by using a process assessment model is based on a two-dimensional
framework. The first dimension is provided by processes defined in a process reference model (process dimension). The
second dimension consists of capability levels that are further subdivided into process attributes (capability
dimension). The process attributes provide the measurable characteristics of process capability.

The process assessment model selects processes from a process reference model and supplements with indicators. These
indicators support the collection of objective evidence which enable an assessor to assign ratings for processes
according to the capability dimension.

The relationship is shown in Figure 1:

   Figure 1 — Process assessment model relationship

3.1. Process reference model
----------------------------

Processes are grouped by process category and at a second level into process groups according to the type of activity
they address.

There are 3 process categories: Primary life cycle processes, Organizational life cycle processes and Supporting life
cycle processes.

Each process is described in terms of a purpose statement. The purpose statement contains the unique functional
objectives of the process when performed in a particular environment. For each purpose statement a list of specific
outcomes is associated, as a list of expected positive results of the process performance.

For the process dimension, the Automotive SPICE process reference model provides the set of processes shown in Figure 2.

3.2. Measurement framework 
---------------------------

The measurement framework provides the necessary requirements and rules for the capability dimension. It defines a
schema which enables an assessor to determine the capability level of a given process. These capability levels are
defined as part of the measurement framework.

To enable the rating, the measurement framework provides process attributes defining a measurable property of process
capability. Each process attribute is assigned to a specific capability level. The extent of achievement of a certain
process attribute is represented by means of a rating based on a defined rating scale. The rules from which an assessor
can derive a final capability level for a given process are represented by a process capability level model.

Automotive SPICE 3.1 uses the measurement framework defined in ISO/IEC 33020:2015.

.. note:: *NOTE: Text incorporated from ISO/IEC 33020 within this chapter is written in italic font and marked with a left
   side bar.*

3.2.1. Process capability levels and process attributes 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The process capability levels and process attributes are identical to those defined in ISO/IEC 33020 clause 5.2. The
detailed descriptions of the capability levels and the corresponding process attributes can be found in chapter 5.

Process attributes are features of a process that can be evaluated on a scale of achievement, providing a measure of the
capability of the process. They are applicable to all processes.

A capability level is a set of process attribute(s) that work together to provide a major enhancement in the capability
to perform a process. Each attribute addresses a specific aspect of the capability level. The levels constitute a
rational way of progressing through improvement of the capability of any process.

According to ISO/IEC 33020 there are six capability levels, incorporating nine process attributes:

.. table:: Table 10 — Process capability levels according to ISO/IEC 33020

   |                             | *Quantitative management needs are identified, measurement data are collected    |
   |                             | and analyzed to identify assignable causes of variation.*                        |
   |                             |                                                                                  |
   |                             | *Corrective action is taken to address assignable causes of variation.*          |

3.2.2. Process attribute rating 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To support the rating of process attributes, the ISO/IEC 33020 measurement framework provides a defined rating scale
with an option for refinement, different rating methods and different aggregation methods depending on the class of the
assessment (e.g. required for organizational maturity assessments).

*Rating scale* 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Within this process measurement framework, a process attribute is a measureable property of process capability. A
process attribute rating is a judgement of the degree of achievement of the process attribute for the assessed process.*

The rating scale is defined by ISO/IEC 33020 as shown in table 12.

.. table:: Table 12 — Rating scale according to ISO/IEC 33020

   +------+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | **N**| *Not achieved*       | *There is little or no evidence of achievement of the defined process       |
   |      |                      | attribute in the assessed process.*                                         |
   +------+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | **P**| *Partially achieved* | *There is some evidence of an approach to, and some achievement of,         |
   |      |                      | the defined process attribute in the assessed process.*                     |

*Rating and aggregation method*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ISO/IEC 33020 provides the following definitions:

*A process outcome is the observable result of successful achievement of the process purpose.*

*A process attribute outcome is the observable result of achievement of a specified process attribute.*

*Process outcomes and process attribute outcomes may be characterised as an intermediate step to providing a process
attribute rating.*

*When performing rating, the rating method employed shall be specified relevant to the class of assessment. The
following rating methods are defined.*

*The use of rating method may vary according to the class, scope and context of an assessment. The lead assessor shall
decide which (if any) rating method to use. The selected rating method(s) shall be specified in the assessment input and
referenced in the assessment report.*

ISO/IEC 33020 provides the following 3 rating methods:

Rating method R1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*The approach to process attribute rating shall satisfy the following conditions:*

a) *Each process outcome of each process within the scope of the assessment shall be characterized for each process
   instance, based on validated data;*

b) *Each process attribute outcome of each process attribute for each process within the scope of the assessment shall
   be characterised for each process instance, based on validated data;*

c) *Process outcome characterisations for all assessed process instances shall be aggregated to provide a process
   performance attribute achievement rating;*

d) *Process attribute outcome characterisations for all assessed process instances shall be aggregated to provide a
   process attribute achievement rating.*

Rating method R2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*The approach to process attribute rating shall satisfy the following conditions:*

a) *Each process attribute for each process within the scope of the assessment shall be characterized for each process
   instance, based on validated data;*

b) *Process attribute characterisations for all assessed process instances shall be aggregated to provide a process
   attribute achievement rating.*

Rating method R3 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Process attribute rating across assessed process instances shall be made without aggregation.*

In principle the three rating methods defined in ISO/IEC 33020 depend on

a) whether the rating is made only on process attribute level (Rating method 3 and 2) or – with more level of detail –
   both on process attribute and process attribute outcome level (Rating method 1); and

b) the type of aggregation ratings across the assessed process instances for each process

If a rating is performed for both process attributes and process attribute outcomes (Rating method 1), the result will
be a process performance attribute outcome rating on level 1 and a process attribute achievement rating on higher
levels.

Depending on the class, scope and context of the assessment an aggregation within one process (one-dimensional, vertical
aggregation), across multiple process instances (one-dimensional, horizontal aggregation) or both (two-dimensional,
matrix aggregation) is performed.

ISO/IEC 33020 provides the following examples:

*When performing an assessment, ratings may be summarised across one or two dimensions.*

*For example, when rating a*

-  *process attribute for a given process, one may aggregate ratings of the associated process (attribute) outcomes –
   such an aggregation will be performed as a vertical aggregation (one dimension).*

-  *process (attribute) outcome for a given process attribute across multiple process instances, one may aggregate the
   ratings of the associated process instances for the given process (attribute) outcome such an aggregation will be
   performed as a horizontal aggregation (one dimension)*

-  *process attribute for a given process, one may aggregate the ratings of all the process (attribute) outcomes for all
   the processes instances – such an aggregation will be performed as a matrix aggregation across the full scope of
   ratings (two dimensions)*

The standard defines different methods for aggregation. Further information can be taken from ISO/IEC 33020.

3.2.3. Process capability level model
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The process capability level achieved by a process shall be derived from the process attribute ratings for that process
according to the process capability level model defined in Table 16.

The process capability level model defines the rules how the achievement of each level depends on the rating of the
process attributes for the assessed and all lower levels.

As a general rule the achievement of a given level requires a largely achievement of the corresponding process
attributes and a full achievement of any lower lying process attribute.

3.3. Process assessment model 
------------------------------

The process assessment model offers indicators in order to identify whether the process outcomes and the process
attribute outcomes (achievements) are present or absent in the instantiated processes of projects and organizational
units. These indicators provide guidance for assessors in accumulating the necessary objective evidence to support
judgments of capability. They are not intended to be regarded as a mandatory set of checklists to be followed.

In order to judge the presence or absence of process outcomes and process achievements an assessment obtains objective
evidence. All such evidence comes from the examination of work products and repository content of the assessed
processes, and from testimony provided by the performers and managers of the assessed processes. This evidence is mapped
to the PAM indicators to allow establishing the correspondence to the relevant process outcomes and process attribute
achievements.

There are two types of indicators:

-  **Process performance indicators**, which apply exclusively to capability Level 1. They provide an indication of the
   extent of fulfillment of the process outcomes

-  **Process capability indicators**, which apply to Capability Levels 2 to 5. They provide an indication of the extent
   of fulfillment of the process attribute achievements.

Assessment indicators are used to confirm that certain practices were performed, as shown by evidence collected during
an assessment. All such evidence comes either from the examination of work products of the processes assessed, or from
statements made by the performers and managers of the processes. The existence of base practices and work products
provide evidence of the performance of the processes associated with them. Similarly, the existence of process
capability indicators provides evidence of process capability.

The evidence obtained should be recorded in a form that clearly relates to an associated indicator, in order that
support for the assessor’s judgment can be confirmed or verified as required by ISO/IEC 33002.

3.3.1. Process performance indicators 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Types of process performance indicators are

   • Base practices (BP)
   • Work products (WP).

Both BPs and WPs relate to one or more process outcomes. Consequently, BPs and WPs are always process-specific and not
generic. BPs represent activity-oriented indicators. WPs represent resultoriented indicators. Both BP and WP are used
for judging objective evidence that an assessor is to collect, and accumulate, in the performance of an assessment. In
that respect BPs and WPs are alternative indicator sets the assessor can use.

The PAM offers a set of work product characteristics (WPC, see Annex B) for each WP. These are meant to offer a good
practice and state-of-the-art knowledge guide for the assessor. Therefore, WP and WPC are supposed to be a quickly
accessible information source during an assessment. In that respect WPs and WPCs represent an example structure only.
They are neither a "strict must" nor are they normative for organizations. Instead, the actual structure, form and
content of concrete work products and documents for the implemented processes must be defined by the project and
organization, respectively. The project and/or organization ensures that the work products are appropriate for the
intended purpose and needs, and in relation to the development goals.

3.3.2. Process capability indicators 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Types of process capability indicators are:

-  Generic Practice (GP)

-  Generic Resource (GR)

Both GPs and GRs relate to one or more PA Achievements. In contrast to process performance indicators, however, they are
of generic type, i.e. they apply to any process.

The difference between GP and GR is that the former represent activity-oriented indicators while the latter represent
infrastructure- oriented indicators for judging objective evidence. An assessor has to collect and accumulate evidence
supporting process capability indicators during an assessment. In that respect GPs and GRs are alternative indicators
sets the assessor can use.

In spite of the fact that level 1 capability of a process is only characterized by the measure of the extent to which
the process outcomes are achieved the measurement framework (see chapter 3.2) requires each level to reveal a process
attribute, and, thus, requires the PAM to introduce at least one process capability indicator. Therefore, the only
process performance attribute for capability Level 1 (PA.1.1) has a single generic practice (GP 1.1.1) pointing as an
editorial reference to the respective process performance indicators (see Figure 3).

3.3.3. Understanding the level of abstraction of a PAM 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The term "process" can be understood at three levels of abstraction. Note that these levels of abstraction are not meant
to define a strict black-or-white split, nor is it the aim to provide a scientific classification schema – the message
here is to understand that, in practice, when it comes to the term "process" there are different abstraction levels, and
that a PAM resides at the highest.

.. figure:: media/figure4.png

   Figure 4 — Possible levels of abstraction for the term "process"

Capturing experience acquired during product development (i.e. at the DOING level) in order to share this experience
with others means creating a HOW level. However, a HOW is always specific to a particular context such as a company, an
organizational unit, or a product line. For example, the HOW of a project, organizational unit, or company A is
potentially not applicable as is to a project, organizational unit, or company B. However, both might be expected to
adhere the principles represented by PAM indicators for process outcomes and process attribute achievements. These
indicators are at the WHAT level while deciding on solutions for concrete templates, proceedings, and tooling etc. is
left to the HOW level.

4. Process reference model and performance indicators (Level 1)
===============================================================

The processes in the process dimension can be drawn from the Automotive SPICE process reference model, which is
incorporated in the tables below indicated by a red bar at the left side.

Each table related to one process in the process dimension contains the process reference model (indicated by a red bar)
and the process performance indicators necessary to define the process assessment model. The process performance
indicators consist of base practices (indicated by a green bar) and output work products (indicated by a blue bar).

      -  tools and repositories;

      -  criteria for configuration items;

      -  naming conventions;

      -  access rights;

      -  criteria for baselines;

      -  merge and branch strategy;

      -  the revision history approach for configuration items

   *NOTE 1: The configuration management strategy typically supports the handling of
   product/software variants which may be caused by different sets of application
   parameters or by other causes.*

   *NOTE 2: The branch management strategy specifies in which cases branching is
   permissible, whether authorization is required, how branches are merged, and which
   activities are required to verify that all changes have been consistently integrated
   without damage to other changes or to the original software.*

   .. stake_req:: SUP.8.BP2: Identify configuration items.
      :id: SUP8_BP2
      :status: new
      :safety_level: not set
      :security_level: not set

   **Base practices**

   .. stake_req:: SUP.9.BP1: Develop a problem resolution management strategy.
      :id: SUP9_BP1
      :status: new
      :safety_level: not set
      :security_level: not set
      :output: SUP9_OUT1

      Develop a problem
      resolution management strategy, including problem resolution activities, a status model
      for the problems, alert notifications, responsibilities for performing these activities
      and an urgent resolution strategy. Interfaces to affected parties are defined and
      definitions are maintained.

   *NOTE 1: Problem resolution activities can be different during the product life cycle,
   e.g. during prototype construction and series development.*

   .. stake_req:: SUP.9.BP2: Identify and record the problem.
      :id: SUP9_BP2
      :status: new
      :safety_level: not set
      :security_level: not set
      :output: SUP9_OUT2

      Each problem is uniquely identified,
      described and recorded. Supporting information should be provided to reproduce and
      diagnose the problem.

   *NOTE 2: Supporting information typically includes the origin of the problem, how it
   can be reproduced, environmental information, by whom it has been detected, etc.*

   *NOTE 3: Unique identification supports traceability to changes made.*

   .. stake_req:: SUP.9.BP3: Record the status of problems.
      :id: SUP9_BP3
      :status: new
      :safety_level: not set
      :security_level: not set
      :output: SUP9_OUT6

      A status according to the status model is assigned to each problem to facilitate tracking.

   .. stake_req:: SUP.9.BP4: Diagnose the cause and determine the impact of the problem.
      :id: SUP9_BP4
      :status: new
      :safety_level: not set
      :security_level: not set
      :output: SUP9_OUT2, SUP9_OUT3

      Investigate the problem and determine its cause and impact in order to categorize the problem and to
      determine appropriate actions.

   *NOTE 4: Problem categorization (e.g. A, B, C, light, medium, severe) may be based on
   severity, impact, criticality, urgency, relevance for the change process, etc.*

   .. stake_req:: SUP.9.BP5: Authorize urgent resolution action.

   *NOTE 5: Appropriate actions may include the initiating of a change request. See SUP.10
   for managing of change requests.*

   *NOTE 6: The implementation of process improvements (to prevent problems) is done in
   the process improvement process (PIM.3).The implementation of generic project
   management improvements (e.g. lessons learned) are part of the project management
   process (MAN.3). The implementation of generic work product related improvements are
   part of the quality assurance process (SUP.1).*

      :status: new
      :safety_level: not set
      :security_level: not set
      :output: MAN5_OUT5, MAN5_OUT6

      For each risk (or set of risks) define measures (e.g. metrics) to determine changes in the
      status of a risk and to evaluate the progress of the of mitigation activities.
      Apply and assess these risk measures.

   *NOTE 6: Major risks may need to be communicated to and monitored by higher levels of management.*

   .. stake_req:: MAN.5.BP7: Take corrective action.
      :id: MAN5_BP7
      :status: new
      :safety_level: not set

      commitment is established to provide resources to sustain improvement actions;

   .. stake_req:: 2
      :id: PIM3_OUT2
      :status: new
      :safety_level: not set
      :security_level: not set
      :output: 08-00, 13-16, 15-05, 15-16

      issues arising from the organization's internal/external environment are identified as

   .. stake_req:: 3
      :id: PIM3_OUT3
      :status: new
      :safety_level: not set
      :security_level: not set
      :output: 15-05, 15-13, 15-16

      analysis of the current status of the existing process is performed, focusing on those
      processes from which improvement stimuli arise;

   .. stake_req:: 4
      :id: PIM3_OUT4
      :status: new
      :safety_level: not set
      :security_level: not set
      :output: 05-00, 06-04, 08-00, 08-29, 10-00, 15-05, 15-16, 16-06

      improvement goals are identified and prioritized, and consequent changes to the process
      are defined, planned and implemented;

   .. stake_req:: 5
      :id: PIM3_OUT5
      :status: new
      :safety_level: not set
      :security_level: not set
      :output: 15-05, 15-13

      the effects of process implementation are monitored, measured and confirmed against the

      :status: new
      :safety_level: not set
      :security_level: not set
      :output: 08-00, 15-05, 15-16

      the improvements made are evaluated and consideration given for using the solution
      elsewhere within the organization.

   **Base practices**

   .. stake_req:: PIM.3.BP1: Establish commitment.
      :id: PIM3_BP1
      :status: new
      :safety_level: not set
      :security_level: not set
      :output: PIM3_OUT1

      Commitment is established to support the process
      group, to provide resources and further enablers (trainings, methods, infrastructure,
      etc.) to sustain improvement actions.

   *NOTE 1: The process improvement process is a generic process, which can be used at all
   levels (e.g. organizational level, process level, project level, etc.) and which can be
   used to improve all other processes.*

   *NOTE 2: Commitment at all levels of management may support process improvement.
   Personal goals may be set for the relevant managers to enforce management commitment.*

   .. stake_req:: PIM.3.BP2: Identify issues.
      :id: PIM3_BP2
      :status: new
      :safety_level: not set
      :security_level: not set
      :output: PIM3_OUT2, PIM3_OUT3

      Processes and interfaces are continuously analyzed to
      identify issues arising from the organization’s internal/external environment as
      improvement opportunities, and with justified reasons for change. This includes issues and
      improvement suggestions addressed by the customer.

   *NOTE 3: Continuous analysis may include problem report trend analysis (see SUP.9),
   analysis from Quality Assurance and Verification results and records (see
   SUP.1 – SUP.2), validation results and records, and product quality measures like ppm
   and recalls.*

   *NOTE 4: Information sources providing input for change may include: process assessment
   results, audits, customer's satisfaction reports, organizational
   effectiveness/efficiency, cost of quality.*

   .. stake_req:: PIM.3.BP3: Establish process improvement goals.
      :id: PIM3_BP3
      :status: new
      :safety_level: not set
      :security_level: not set
      :output: PIM3_OUT3

      Analysis of the current status of the
      existing process is performed, focusing on those processes from which improvement stimuli
      arise, resulting in improvement objectives for the processes being established.

   *NOTE 5: The current status of processes may be determined by process assessment.*

   .. stake_req:: PIM.3.BP4: Prioritize improvements.
      :id: PIM3_BP4
      :status: new
      :safety_level: not set
      :security_level: not set
      :output: PIM3_OUT4

      The improvement objectives and improvement activities are prioritized.

      :status: new
      :safety_level: not set
      :security_level: not set
      :output: PIM3_OUT4

      Consequent changes to the process are defined and planned.

   *NOTE 6: Process changes may only be possible if the complete supply chain improves
   (all relevant parties).*

   *NOTE 7: Traditionally process changes are mostly applied to new projects. Within the
   automotive industry, changes could be implemented per project phase (e.g. product
   sample phases A, B, C), yielding a higher improvement rate. Also, the principle of low
   hanging fruit (that is implementing easy improvements first) may be considered when
   planning process changes.*

   *NOTE 8: Improvements may be planned in continuous incremental small steps. Also,
   improvements are usually piloted before roll out at the organization.*

   .. stake_req:: PIM.3.BP6: Implement process changes.
      :id: PIM3_BP6
      :status: new
      :safety_level: not set
      :security_level: not set
      :output: PIM3_OUT4

      The improvements to the processes are
      implemented. Process documentation is updated and people are trained.

   *NOTE 9: This practice includes defining the processes and making sure these processes
   are applied. Process application can be supported by establishing policies, adequate
   process infrastructure (tools, templates, example artifacts, etc.), process training,
   process coaching and tailoring processes to local needs.*

   .. stake_req:: PIM.3.BP7: Confirm process improvement.
      :id: PIM3_BP7
      :status: new
      :safety_level: not set
      :security_level: not set
      :output: PIM3_OUT5

      The effects of process implementation are
      monitored, measured and confirmed against the defined improvement goals.

   *NOTE 10: Examples of measures may be metrics for goal achievement, process definition
   and process adherence.*

   .. stake_req:: PIM.3.BP8: Communicate results of improvement.
      :id: PIM3_BP8
      :status: new
      :safety_level: not set
      :security_level: not set
      :output: PIM3_OUT6

      Knowledge gained from the improvements
      and progress of the improvement implementation is communicated outside of the improvement
      project across relevant parts of the organization and to the customer (as appropriate).

   .. stake_req:: PIM.3.BP9: Evaluate the results of the improvement project.
      :id: PIM3_BP9
      :status: new
      :safety_level: not set
      :security_level: not set
      :output: PIM3_OUT7

      Evaluate the results of
      the improvement project to check whether the solution was successful and can be used
      elsewhere in the organization.

5. Process capability levels and process attributes 
====================================================

Process capability indicators are the means of achieving the capabilities addressed by the considered process
attributes. Evidence of process capability indicators supports the judgment of the degree of achievement of the process
attribute.

The capability dimension of the process assessment model consists of six capability levels matching the capability
levels defined in ISO/IEC 33020. The process capability indicators for the 9 process attributes included in the
capability dimension for process capability level 1 to 5 are described.

Each of the process attributes in this process assessment model is identical to the process attribute defined in the
process measurement framework. The generic practices address the characteristics from each process attribute. The
generic resources relate to the process attribute as a whole.

Process capability level 0 does not include any type of indicators, as it reflects a non-implemented process or a
process which fails to partially achieve any of its outcomes.

   *NOTE: ISO/IEC 33020 process attribute definitions and attribute outcomes are duplicated from ISO/IEC 33020 in italic
   font and marked with a left side bar.*


5.1. Process capability Level 0: Incomplete process 
----------------------------------------------------

*The process is not implemented, or fails to achieve its process purpose. At this level there is little or no evidence
of any systematic achievement of the process purpose.*

5.2. Process capability Level 1: Performed process 
---------------------------------------------------

*The implemented process achieves its process purpose. The following process attribute demonstrates the
achievement of this level*

5.2.1. PA 1.1 Process performance process attribute 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*The process performance process attribute is a measure of the extent to which the process purpose is achieved.
As a result of full achievement of this attribute:*

*a) the process achieves its defined outcomes*

5.4. Process capability Level 3: Established process 
-----------------------------------------------------

*The previously described Managed process is now implemented using a defined process that is capable of achieving its
process outcomes.*

*The following process attributes, together with the previously defined process attributes, demonstrate the achievement
of this level:*

5.4.1. PA 3.1 Process definition process attribute 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*The process definition process attribute is a measure of the extent to which a standard process is maintained to
support the deployment of the defined process. As a result of full achievement of this process attribute:*

a) *A standard process, including appropriate tailoring guidelines, is defined and maintained that describes the
   fundamental elements that must be incorporated into a defined process;*

b) *The sequence and interaction of the standard process with other processes is determined.*

c) *Required competencies and roles for performing the process are identified as part of the standard process;*

d) *Required infrastructure and work environment for performing the process are identified as part of the standard
   process;*

e) *Suitable methods and measures for monitoring the effectiveness and suitability of the process are determined.*

5.5. Process capability Level 4: Predictable process 
-----------------------------------------------------

*The previously described Established process now operates predictively within defined limits to achieve its process
outcomes. Quantitative management needs are identified, measurement data are collected and analysed to identify
assignable causes of variation. Corrective action is taken to address assignable causes of variation.*

*The following process attributes, together with the previously defined process attributes, demonstrate the achievement
of this level:*

5.5.1. PA 4.1 Quantitative analysis process attribute 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*The quantitative analysis process attribute is a measure of the extent to which information needs are defined,
relationships between process elements are identified and data are collected. As a result of full achievement of this
process attribute:*

a) *The process is aligned with quantitative business goals;*

b) *Process information needs in support of relevant defined quantitative business goals are established;*

c) *Process measurement objectives are derived from process information needs;*

d) *Measurable relationships between process elements that contribute to the process performance are identified;*

e) *Quantitative objectives for process performance in support of relevant business goals are established;*

f) *Appropriate measures and frequency of measurement are identified and defined in line with process measurement
   objectives and quantitative objectives for process performance;*

g) *Results of measurement are collected, validated and reported in order to monitor the extent to which the
   quantitative objectives for process performance are met.*

..

   *NOTE 1: Information needs typically reflect management, technical, project, process or product needs.*

*[ISO/IEC 33004, 5.4]*

A.3 Conformance to the requirements for process assessment models 
------------------------------------------------------------------

*Clause 6.1, "Introduction"* 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The purpose of this process assessment model is to support assessment of process capability within the automotive domain
using the process measurement framework defined in ISO/IEC 33020.

*[ISO/IEC 33004, 6.1]*

*Clause 6.2, "Process assessment model scope"* 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The process scope of this process assessment model is defined in the process reference model included in chapter 3.1 of
this document. The Automotive SPICE process reference model is satisfying the requirements of ISO/IEC 33004, clause 5 as
described in Annex A.2.

The process capability scope of this process assessment model is defined in the process measurement framework specified
in ISO/IEC 33020, which defines a process measurement framework for process capability satisfying the requirements of
ISO/IEC 33003.

*[ISO/IEC 33004, 6.2]*

*Clause 6.3, "Requirements for process assessment models"* 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Automotive SPICE process assessment model is related to process capability.

*[ISO/IEC 33004, 6.3.1]*

This process assessment model incorporates the process measurement framework specified in ISO/IEC 33020, which satisfies
the requirements of ISO/IEC 33003.

*[ISO/IEC 33004, 6.3.2]*

This process assessment model is based on the Automotive SPICE Reference Model included in this document.

This process assessment model is based on the Measurement Framework defined in ISO/IEC 33020.

*[ISO/IEC 33004, 6.3.3]*

The processes included in this process assessment model are identical to those specified in the Process Reference Model

*[ISO/IEC 33004, 6.3.4]*

For all processes in this process assessment model all levels defined in the process measurement framework from ISO/IEC
33020 are addressed.

*[ISO/IEC 33004, 6.3.5]*

This process assessment model defines

-  the selected process quality characteristic;

-  the selected process measurement framework;

-  the selected process reference model(s);

-  the selected processes from the process reference model(s)

in chapter 3 of this document.

*[ISO/IEC 33004, 6.3.5 a-d]*

In the capability dimension, this process assessment model addresses all of the process attributes and capability levels
defined in the process measurement framework in ISO/IEC 33020. *[ISO/IEC 33004, 6.3.5 e]*

*Clause 6.3.1, "Assessment indicators"*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   *NOTE: Due to an error in numbering in the published version of ISO/IEC 33004 the following reference numbers are
   redundant to those stated above. To refer to the correct clauses from ISO/IEC 33004, the text of clause heading is
   additionally specified for the following three requirements.*

The Automotive SPICE process assessment model provides a two-dimensional view of process capability for the processes in
the process reference model, through the inclusion of assessment indicators as defined in chapter 3.3. The assessment
indicators used are:

-  Base practices and output work products

*[ISO/IEC 33004, 6.3.1 a, "Assessment indicators"]*

-  Generic practices and Generic resources

*[ISO/IEC 33004, 6.3.1 b, "Assessment indicators"]*

*Clause 6.3.2, "Mapping process assessment models to process reference models"*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mapping of the assessment indicators to the purpose and process outcomes of the processes in the process reference
model is included in each description of the base practices in chapter 4.

The mapping of the assessment indicators to the process attributes in the process measurement framework including all of
the process attribute achievements is included in each description of the generic practices in chapter 5.

Each mapping is indicated by a reference in square brackets.

*[ISO/IEC 33004, 6.3.2, "Mapping process assessment models"]*

*Clause 6.3.3, "Expression of assessment results"*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The process attributes and the process attribute ratings in this process assessment model are identical to those defined
in the measurement framework. As a consequence, results of assessments based upon this process assessment model are
expressed directly as a set of process attribute ratings for each process within the scope of the assessment. No form of
translation or conversion is required.

*[ISO/IEC 33004, 6.3.3, "Expression of assessment results"]*

Annex B Work product characteristics
====================================

Work product characteristics listed in this Annex can be used when reviewing potential outputs of process
implementation. The characteristics are provided as guidance for the attributes to look for, in a particular sample work
product, to provide objective evidence supporting the assessment of a particular process.

A documented process and assessor judgment is needed to ensure that the process context (application domain, business
purpose, development methodology, size of the organization, etc.) is considered when using this information.

Work products are defined using the schema in table B.1. Work products and their characteristics should be considered as
a starting point for considering whether, given the context, they are contributing to the intended purpose of the
process, not as a check-list of what every organization must have.

.. table:: Table B.1 — Structure of WPC tables

   +--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |    Work product    | An identifier number for the work product which is used to reference the work product.     |
   |                    |                                                                                            |
   |    identifier      |                                                                                            |
   +====================+============================================================================================+
   |    Work product    | Provides an example of a typical name associated with the work product characteristics.    |
   |    name            | This name is provided as an identifier of the type of work product the practice or         |
   |                    | process might produce. Organizations may call these work products by different names. The  |
   |                    | name of the work product in the organization is not significant. Similarly, organizations  |
   |                    | may have several equivalent work products which contain the characteristics defined in     |
   |                    | one work product type. The formats for the work products can vary. It is up to the         |
   |                    | assessor and the organizational unit coordinator to map the actual work products produced  |
   |                    | in their organization to the examples given here.                                          |
   +--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |    Work product    | Provides examples of the potential characteristics associated with the work product types. |
   |    characteristics |  The assessor may look for these in the samples provided by the organizational unit.       |
   +--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Work products (with the ID NN-00) are sets of characteristics that would be expected to be evident in work products of
generic types as a result of achievement of an attribute. The generic work products form the basis for the
classification of specific work products defined as process performance indicators.

Specific work product types are typically created by process owners and applied by process deployers in order to satisfy
an outcome of a particular process purpose.

*NOTE: The generic work products denoted with `*` are not used in the Automotive SPICE process assessment model but
are included for completeness.*

Annex D Key concepts
====================

The following sections describe the key concepts that have been introduced in the Automotive SPICE PRM resp. PAM 3.1.
They relate to the terminology described in Annex C Terminology.

D.1 The "Plug-in" concept
-------------------------

The following figure shows the basic principle of the "plug-in" concept. The top-level comprises all system engineering
processes organized in a system "V". Depending on the product to be developed the corresponding engineering disciplines
with their domain-specific processes (e.g. hardware engineering HWE, mechanical engineering MEE, or software engineering
SWE) can be added to the assessment scope. All other processes such as management processes and supporting processes are
domain-independent and are therefore designed in a way that they can be applied to both the system level and the domain
levels.

.. figure:: media/figureD.1.png

   Figure D.1 — The "Plug-in" concept

All processes printed in bold are part of the Automotive SPICE 3.1 PRM/PAM whereas the other processes (mechanical
engineering and hardware engineering) are not developed under VDA QMC mandate.

D.2 The Tip of the "V"
----------------------

All engineering processes (i.e. system engineering and software engineering) have been organized according to the "V
model" principle in such a way that each process on the left side is corresponding to exactly one process on the right
side. Therefore, the process SWE.3 "Software Detailed Design and Unit Construction" is separated from the process SWE.4
"Software Unit Verification".

.. figure:: media/figureD.2.png

   Figure D.2 — The tip of the "V"

D.3 Terms "Element", "Component", "Unit", and "Item"
----------------------------------------------------

The following figure depicts the relationships between element, component, software unit, and item, which are used
consistently in the engineering processes.

.. figure:: media/figureD.3.png

   Figure D.3 — Element, component, unit, and item

An architecture consists of architectural "elements" that can be further decomposed into more fine-grained
architectural sub-"elements" across appropriate hierarchical levels. The software "components" are the lowest-level
"elements" of the software architecture for which finally the detailed design is defined. A software "component"
consists of one or more software "units".

"Items" on the right side of the V-model correspond to "elements" on the left side (e.g. a software "item" can be an
object file, a library or an executable). This can be a 1:1 or m:n relationship, e.g. an "item" may represent more than
one architectural "element".

D.4 Traceability and consistency
--------------------------------

Traceability and consistency are addressed by two separate base practices in the Automotive SPICE 3.1 PAM. Traceability
refers to the existence of references or links between work products thereby further supporting coverage, impact
analysis, requirements implementation status tracking etc. In contrast, consistency addresses content and semantics.

Furthermore, bidirectional traceability has been explicitly defined between

-  test cases and test results, and

-  change requests and work products affected by these change requests.

An overview of bidirectional traceability and consistency is depicted in the following figure.

.. figure:: media/figureD.4.png
   :name:  ASPICE-V31-Figure-D4—Bidirectional-traceability-and-consistency
   :width: 6.72667in
   :height: 3.95in

   Figure D.4 — Bidirectional traceability and consistency

D.5 "Agree" and "Summarize and Communicate"
-------------------------------------------

The information flow on the left side of the "V" is ensured through a base practice "Communicate agreed ‘work product
x’". The term "agreed" here means that there is a joint understanding between affected parties of what is meant by the
content of the work product.

The information flow on the right side of the "V" is ensured through a base practice "Summarize and communicate
results". The term "Summarize" refers to abstracted information resulting from test executions made available to all
relevant parties.

Note that these communication-oriented base practices do not necessarily require a formal approval, confirmation, or
release as rather targeted at by GP 2.1.7 on capability level 2. At capability level 1 the communication-oriented base
practices mean that the work products (or their content) are to be disseminated to relevant parties.

.. figure:: media/figureD.5.png

   Figure D.5 — Agree, summarize and communicate

D.6 "Evaluate", "Verification Criteria" and "Ensuring compliance"
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This section describes relations, differences, and commonalities between verification, testing, evaluation, and
compliance. The following Figure D.6 provides an overview.

Verification criteria are used as input for the development of the test cases or other verification measures that
ensures compliance with the requirements. Verification criteria are only used in the context of System Requirements
Analysis (SYS.2) and Software Requirements Analysis (SWE.1) processes. Verification aspects which cannot be covered by
testing are covered by the verification process (SUP.2).

Criteria for unit verification ensure compliance of the source code with the software detailed design and the
non-functional requirements. Possible criteria for unit verification include unit test cases, unit test data, coverage
goals and coding standards and coding guidelines, e.g. MISRA. For unit testing, such criteria shall be defined in a unit
test specification. This unit test specification may be implemented e.g. as a script in an automated test bench.

.. figure:: media/figureD.6.png

   Figure D.6 — Evaluation, verification criteria and compliance

Evaluation of alternative solutions is required for system and software architectures as well as for software detailed
designs. The evaluation has to be done according to defined criteria. Such evaluation criteria may include quality
characteristics like modularity, reliability, security, and usability, or results of make-or-buy or reuse analysis. The
evaluation result including a rationale for the architecture/design selection has to be recorded.

Compliance with an architectural design means that the specified integration tests are capable of proving that
interfaces and relevant interactions between

-  the software units,

-  the software items and

-  the system items

fulfill the specification given by the architectural design.

D.7 The relation between "Strategy" and "Plan"
----------------------------------------------

Both terms "Strategy" and "Plan" are commonly used across following processes of the Automotive SPICE 3.1 PAM:

.. table::

   +------+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   +------+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | •    | SUP.8      |    Configuration Management                                              |
   +------+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | •    | SUP.9      |    Problem Resolution Management                                         |
   +------+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | •    | SUP.10     |    Change Request Management                                             |
   +------+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The following figure shows the general relationship between strategy and plan in any of these processes.

.. figure:: media/figureD.7.png

   Figure D.7 — Strategy and plan

**Capability Level 1:**

Each of these processes requires the development of a process-specific strategy. The strategy always corresponds to a
process-specific "Plan". For each process-specific "Plan" there are processspecific work product characteristics defined
(e.g. "08-52 Test Plan", "08-04 Configuration Management Plan").

**Capability Level 2 or higher:**

Each process-specific "Plan" (WP 08-nn) inherits the work product characteristics represented by the Generic Plan (WP
08-00). This means that for a process-specific "Plan" both the process-specific characteristics (WP 08-nn) and the
generic characteristics (WP 08-00) apply.

Annex E Reference standards

Annex E provides a list of reference standards and guidelines that support implementation of the Automotive SPICE PAM /
PRM.
